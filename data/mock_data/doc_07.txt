No Meat May: A Powerful Step Toward Protecting People, Animals, and the Planet

Join the No Meat May movement and discover easy plant-based swaps and how reducing or eliminating your meat consumption can protect animals, workers, and the environment.

Each May, thousands of people across the globe commit to going meat-free for 31 days. No Meat May isn’t just about changing what’s on your plate—it’s about challenging the systems that harm animals, workers, and communities. It’s about rethinking the role meat plays in our lives, our health, and our world.

And the best part? It’s never been easier to participate.

Why No Meat May Matters
Industrial animal agriculture—also known as factory farming—puts profit over people, animals, and the environment. It treats living beings like products on an assembly line, but the harms of this system reach even beyond animals.

The people working inside factory farms and slaughterhouses are often forced into grueling, dangerous jobs. Many are immigrants or people of color, working in high-risk conditions for low pay. Injuries are common, and the psychological toll is devastating. Repetitive trauma, poor safety protocols, and constant exposure to suffering animals take a lasting toll.

The communities living near factory farms also bear the brunt. These industrial sites often pollute the air and water with waste runoff, antibiotics, and ammonia. Studies have linked living near factory farms to respiratory illnesses, higher rates of asthma, and mental health impacts. Yet these facilities are disproportionately located in low-income communities and communities of color—a clear example of environmental injustice.

Choosing to go meat-free for May sends a message: we want a food system that doesn’t harm people or animals.

Substituting Without Sacrificing
Whether you’re a long-time vegetarian or a curious first-timer, No Meat May is an opportunity to discover new ways to fuel your body with compassion and flavor.

Here are a few easy swaps for common animal-based ingredients:

Lentils
Packed with protein, fiber, and iron, lentils are an affordable and versatile staple. Use them in tacos, soups, or pasta sauces.

Tofu and tempeh
These soy-based classics soak up flavor like a sponge. Marinate and grill them for a satisfying bite.

Beans and chickpeas

From black bean burgers to creamy hummus, legumes are nutritional powerhouses.

Seitan
Made from wheat gluten, seitan has a chewy, meaty texture that’s perfect for stir-fries, sandwiches, and more.

Plant-based and mushroom root meats

Brands like Beyond Meat, Gardein, Meati, and others make it easy to recreate your favorite dishes with no animals harmed.

Quinoa and whole grains
These grains provide essential amino acids, plus they’re filling and delicious.

If you’re worried about getting a well-rounded meal, don’t be. Most people eating a variety of whole plant foods and plant-based products meet their nutritional needs with ease.

A Better Way Forward
Choosing to reduce or eliminate meat from your diet—during May or beyond—can be an amazing act of compassion. It’s a way to stand in solidarity with workers who are often subjected to cruelty, with animals who suffer in silence, and with communities burdened by an industry that prioritizes profit over health and safety.

This May, join the growing movement for change. Your plate is powerful—let’s use it to build a kinder, healthier world for everyone.
