Nutritional Components Beneficial for Dogs with Cancer: A Review
Cancer in dogs is increasingly common, and nutrition plays a critical role in supportive care. Recent studies highlight several key nutrients that may improve outcomes and quality of life for dogs undergoing cancer treatment.

Key Nutrients and Their Roles
Omega-3 Fatty Acids (EPA and DHA): Known for anti-inflammatory and anti-tumor properties. Sources include fish oils and flaxseeds. Supplementation has shown to slow tumor progression and improve immune response.

Antioxidants (Vitamin E, Vitamin C, Selenium): These combat oxidative stress caused by cancer and its treatments, potentially reducing cellular damage.

High-Quality Protein: Essential for maintaining muscle mass and supporting repair mechanisms. Proteins from fish and lean meats are preferred.

Glutamine: An amino acid that supports gut health and immune function during chemotherapy.

Carbohydrate Management: Low glycemic index carbs such as brown rice and sweet potatoes are recommended to provide steady energy without promoting tumor growth.

Clinical Evidence
Multiple veterinary oncology studies support incorporating these nutrients into diets tailored for cancer patients. Nutritional support should be personalized in collaboration with veterinary professionals.
