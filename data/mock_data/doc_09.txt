Supplements for Dogs with Cancer: Omega-3s, Curcumin, and More

Cancer in dogs is a complex disease, and while traditional treatments like surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation are essential, nutritional support—including the use of supplements—can greatly improve quality of life and even outcomes in some cases.

One of the most researched and widely recommended supplements for dogs with cancer is Omega-3 fatty acids, particularly EPA and DHA. These fatty acids are known for their anti-inflammatory properties and their ability to help preserve lean muscle mass and body weight in cachexic animals. Fish oil is a common source, and veterinary-formulated supplements ensure purity and appropriate dosage.

Curcumin, the active compound in turmeric, is another supplement gaining popularity for its anti-inflammatory and potential anti-cancer effects. Studies have shown that curcumin may inhibit tumor growth and even enhance the effects of chemotherapy. However, it's poorly absorbed on its own, so it's typically given with black pepper extract (piperine) or formulated in liposomal form for better bioavailability.

Another commonly used supplement is medicinal mushrooms, such as turkey tail (Coriolus versicolor), which contains polysaccharide-K (PSK). Research from veterinary oncology shows promise in increasing survival time in dogs with hemangiosarcoma when PSK is administered.

Antioxidants such as Vitamins C and E, selenium, and Coenzyme Q10 are also included in many cancer support protocols. These can reduce oxidative stress and support immune function, but timing and dosing should be carefully managed, especially when used alongside chemotherapy, as some antioxidants may interfere with the oxidative mechanisms that certain drugs rely on.

Probiotics and digestive enzymes can also aid nutrient absorption and support gut health, which is often compromised in dogs undergoing cancer treatment.

Before adding any supplements to a cancer care regimen, it’s essential to consult with a veterinarian, ideally one with experience in integrative oncology. Supplements should never replace standard treatment but can serve as powerful adjuncts to improve vitality, support immunity, and potentially extend life.
